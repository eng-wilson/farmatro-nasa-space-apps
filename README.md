# NASA Farm Navigator: Climate-Smart Farm Manager

An educational game teaching sustainable farming practices using real NASA satellite data, developed for the 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge.

## AI Generation Disclosure

**This project includes AI-generated content and was developed with AI assistance.** The game mechanics, educational content, and user interface elements were created with the help of artificial intelligence tools. The crop health data is fetched directly from NASA's MODIS ORNL API via client-side calls. All content is designed to be educational and aligned with NASA's mission of promoting climate-smart agriculture.

## About the Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project that simulates farm management decisions using real NASA satellite data to teach players about sustainable agriculture practices. Players make strategic decisions about crop management, resource allocation, and environmental stewardship while learning about the impacts of climate change on farming.

## Getting Started
